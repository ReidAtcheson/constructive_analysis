# constructive_analysis
Coq formalization of some constructive real analysis.




# Outline




## Basic Analysis

Analysis over rational numbers.

* Rational numbers are "constructive complete"
  * They are "perfect" in the sense of no isolated points
  * Generalize to Banach algebra
* Sequences
  * Cauchy and convergent sequences
* Sidebar: Simple shapes
  * Set membership function
  * Set union function
  * Set intersection function
  * Set diff function
  * Set equality
* Measures
  * algebra-valued "set" functions
  * Really will just be defined on "simple shapes"
  * Compatible with algebra operations of simple shapes
* Rectifiable 'sets' (types?)
  * Rectifiable set is simple shape or union of disjoint simple shapes
  * A subdivision algorithm
  * Subdivide into disjoint simple shapes
* Integrals
  * The usual integral defined with measures.



## Big Theorems



* Linear Algebra
  * Riesz-Representation for linear functionals and inner products
  * Made constructive by explicit basis
* Measure theory+Linear Algebra
  * Riesz-Representation for measures
  * Should be simple decomposition
* Spectral theorem for hermitian operators
  *
